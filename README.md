## 🎯 Purpose

**EduSight** is a data visualization project built to turn raw educational data into **strategic, human-centered decisions**. It targets **NGOs**, **schools**, and **public policy makers** aiming to:

- Monitor academic performance 📈  
- Track and optimize teaching resources 📚  
- Evaluate the effectiveness of learning programs 🎓

## 🧠 Context

Behind every dataset is a student.  
A dream. A future.

In many underserved areas, **decisions are made blindly** due to a lack of actionable insights.  
**EduSight** bridges that gap by turning disconnected spreadsheets into **clear, strategic dashboards**.
